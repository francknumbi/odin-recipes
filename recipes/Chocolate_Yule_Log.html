    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>If you haven't tried this Yule log recipe because you thought it required advanced baking and pastry skill, then get ready to buche up this Noel, since the techniques required are actually quite simple.
         This classic holiday dessert is a showstopper,
         but it's often better looking than it is tasting,
         which is not the case here, thanks to a simple-to-make, rich chocolate sponge cake,
         and mocha buttercream filling.
         Garnished here with meringue mushrooms and rosemary.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ⅔ cups powdered sugar </li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>⅓ cup mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the buttercream filling: Whip powdered sugar, butter, coffee-flavored liqueur, cocoa powder, 
            salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed.</li>
        <li>Transfer filling mixture to a separate bowl and add mascarpone cheese. Mix until combined; set aside.
             Clean and dry the stand mixer bowl.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare a 13x18-inch rimmed sheet pan for the sponge cake: 
            Brush a little melted butter over the sheet pan, then line the pan with parchment paper,
             and brush remaining melted butter on top.

        </li>
        <li>Whisk cocoa powder, flour, and salt together in a bowl, making sure to break up any clumps.</li>
    </ol>
